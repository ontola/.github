# Ontola

Ontola is a small software company based in Utrecht, the Netherlands.  We like making tools that give people more control over their data.

Currently, we're mostly working on [Atomic Data](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/) and [Atomic Server](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-data-rust/blob/master/server/README.md), a new way to create and share linked data.
