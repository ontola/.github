# Ontola

Ontola is a small software company based in Utrecht, the Netherlands.  We like making tools that give people more control over their data.

Currently, we're mostly working on [Atomic Data](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/) and [Atomic Server](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/atomic-data-rust/blob/master/server/README.md), a new way to create and share linked data. For repositories related to Atomic data, see [atomicdata-dev](https://github.com/atomicdata-dev/).

In the past, we've worked on the Argu.co e-democracy SAAS platform ([open source](https://github.com/ontola/argu)) and on the Solid project (in the [DexPod](https://github.com/ontola/dexpod), as on various libraries).
